# NBA-Data
Since my interest for data started from watching sports games and ESPN all the time, I thought it would only be right to work on a project including those things. In this project, I have compiled stats from the NBA dating back to the 1999-00 season (around when I first started watching basketball). 

There is still a lot of data that I can add and a lot that I can do with what I have already compiled, so many things will continually be added.

Future plans:
  - Compile more data
      - Include more seasons
      - Advanced team stats
      - Advanced player stats
      - Per-game stats
  - Utilizing Python machine learning tools (scikit)
      - MVP predictions (in-progress)
  - Data Visualizations
      - Tableau (in-progess)
  
  All data comes from "www.basketball-reference.com/"
