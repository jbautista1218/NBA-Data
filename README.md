# NBA-Data
Since my interest for data started from watching sports games and ESPN all the time, I thought it would only be right to work on a project including those things. In this project, I have compiled stats from the NBA dating back to the 1999-00 season (around when I first started watching basketball).

Future plans:
  - Compile more data
      - Include more seasons
      - Advanced team stats
      - Advanced player stats
      - Per-game stats
  - Utilizing Python machine learning tools (scikit)
      - MVP predictions (in-progress)
  - More Data Visualizations
  
  All data comes from "www.basketball-reference.com/"
